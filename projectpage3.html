      <p class="w3-justify">In all of galactic history, there have been only a few Jedi Knights who achieved legendary status. Obi-Wan Kenobi is such a Jedi. He is also my absolute favorite character. He was born 57 years before the events of the first Star Wars movie. His master was another revered Jedi known as Qui-Gon Jiin. Together master and student went on many adeventures throughout the galaxy. One notable mission was when Kenobi and Jiin protected the young Duchess Satine Kryze of the planet of Mandalore from assassins. As Jedi Knights were not allowed to harbour romantic feelings, this was very difficult for Kenobi, as he felt himself immensely attracted to her. After protecting the Duchess for a year, the Jedi and her parted ways. </p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> After years of training with Jiin, Kenobi had become a powerful young Jedi. About 32 years before the original movie, Kenobi and his master Jiin were assigned to settle a trade dispute on the planet of Naboo between the Queen of the planet and the wealthy Trade Federation. The negotiations that were to take place never happened as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious ordered an invasion of the planet. Escaping with the Queen, the Jedi and their companions landed on a desert world called Tatooine. There, they discovered a young boy named Anakin Skywalker, who Kenobi's master Jiin believed to be the prophesized Chosen One of the Jedi Order. Taking the boy with them, the Jedi first went to the Galactic Capital of Coruscant to seek help to combat the invasion. When that failed, the company returned to Naboo to recruit the planets natives and fight a massive war on the planet. During the battle, Kenobi and Jiin dueled the Sith Assassin Darth Maul, who ended up slaying Jiin. Kenobi managed to defeat the Sith by slicing him in half. With Jiin`s dying breath, he asked Obi-Wan to train Anakin in the ways of the Force, and Kenobi promised he would.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> Kenobi trained Anakin Skywalker for 10 years. The boy eventually became a very powerful Jedi and was made a Knight of the Order while Kenobi was made a Jedi Master. Shortly after Skywalker was knighted, the galaxy wide conflict known as the Clone Wars broke out. Kenobi and his former apprentice became generals in the conflict,commanding the Republic`s vast clone armies. The duo fought in many battles and faced many foes, such as the new apprentice to Darth Sidious,Count Dooku,and the return of Darth Maul. It is notable that when Maul returned he killed Kenobi's former lover, Duchess Satine Kryze, to gain revenge on the Jedi Master. At the end of the war, Anakin was seduced to the dark side by the Republic Chancellor Palpatine, who in reality was the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Sidious christened Anakin as Darth Vader and was ordered to hunt the Jedi and destroy them. Sidious also issued Clone Order 66, which declared all Jedi as traitors and demanded they be killed on sight. Kenobi escaped his troops and dueled Anakin on the volcanic world of Mustafar. Kenobi won the fight, severed Anakins legs, left arm, and left his old friend to his fate as he burned in the volcanic fires of the planet.</p>
