      <h2 class="w3-wide">Life as a Sith and Redemption</h2>
      <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">After the fall of the Republic, the Galactic Empire was established, with Darth Sidious as its leader Emperor Palpatine. Darth Vader came to be known as the Empire's most lethal enforcer. As the years path and Vader continued to immerse himslef in the Dark Side, he became perhaps the second most poweful Sith in history, next to Palpatine. He was nearly unstopable in a duel and few could match his power. He became a feared Jedi killer and his evil was so deep he killed his former apprentice Ahsoka Tano in a duel on Malachor. For 19 years the Empire reigned nearly unchallenged, and its ultimate weapon, the Death Star Battle Station, a weapon powerful enough to destroy an entire planet, was about to be completed. The few rebels in the galaxy however, formed an Alliance to Restore the Republic and managed to acquire many supporters. The Empire began viewing the Rebellion as a threat after they managed to steal the plans to the Death Star. </p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> Vader was dispatched to reclaim the plans and managed to capture a vessel over his home planet of Tatooine belonging to Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. The ship had the stolen plans but the Princess managed to place the plans in an astromech droid named R2-D2. Leia gave R2 a mission to find Vader`s old master Obi-Wan Kenobi and have him deliver R2 to her father Bail Organa on Alderaan. Vader captured the princess, though not the plans and sent his stormtrooper soldiers to retrieve them. He took the Princess back to the Death Star and tortured her for information on the Rebels base. She did not yield the information however, so the commander of the station, Grand Moff Tarkin, ordered the destruction of Organas home planet of Alderaan. This still failed to break her and so the Empire decided to have her executed. The princess was rescued by a farmboy from tatooine, the smuggler Han Solo and his copilot Chewbacca, the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, and Vaders Jedi mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. As they were escaping the station, Vader dueled and killed Kenobi, who managed to achieve eternal life by becoming a Force Ghost. Vader and the Empire tracked the remainder of the escaped rebels back to the Rebellion`s secret base on the planet of Yavin 4. The Rebels launched an attack on the Death Star in an effort to destroy the Battle Station before it managed to destroy the Rebel Base. Vader attempted to protect the station but the farmboy, a gifted pilot, fired the shot that destroyed the Death Star, sending Vader flying into space in his ship and granting the Rebels another major victory.  </p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> After the Battle of Yavin, Vader relentlessly hunted down the Rebel Pilot who destroyed the Death Star. He discovered the farmboy was in fact Luke Skywalker, his son who Padme had given birth to before she died. Vader deduced that Obi-Wan had brought the boy to his old homeworld of Tatooine to watch over him as he knew Vader would never look there due to him hating anything related to his old life as Anakin. Luke however intrigued Vader as he saw the potential to make the boy his own apprentice to overthrow the Empire and rule the galaxy as father and son. </p>

      <p class="w3-justify">Vader eventually set a trap for Luke on the planet of Bespin by capturing Princess Leia and Han Solo. Luke of course came to his friends aid and dueled Vader. During the Duel Vader was greatly impressed by the boys lightsaber skills, saying Obi-Wan had taught him well. However, young Luke was no match for the Dark Lords experience. Vader fought him to the edge of a reactor shaft and cut off Luke's right hand. Then Vader revealed to Luke the truth of his parentage and invited the young jedi to join him on the dark side. Luke instead chose death and jumped into the shaft below him. However the young Jedi survived and managed to escape to continue his Jedi training. A year passed and Vader managed to capture his son once again on the forest moon of Endor. Luke had come to believe Vader could be redeemed, but Vader did not accept this. Vader brought Luke before his master Emperor Palpatine on the second Death Star, where the two Sith attempted to turn Luke to the dark side. Things came to a head when Luke and Vader engaged in yet another lightsaber duel. They were evenly matched until Vader discovered through probing Luke's mind that Princess Leia was Lukes twin sister, and Vaders daughter. Taunting Luke with the prospect of corrupting Leia, Luke became enraged and managed to defeat Vader in their duel. The Emperor urged Luke to kill Vader, but Luke refused proclaiming himself a Jedi. The Emperor became enraged and attempted to kill Luke with his Force Lightning. Vader however, could not bear to see his son die and finally broke free of the Dark Side's control. Now Anakin once more, Skywalker hurled Palpatine down a reactor shaft to his death. Anakins suit however received extensive damage and there was no chance that he could survive. Asking to see his son once wih his own eyes, Luke removed his father's helmet and stayed by his side as Anakin died. As he was passing into death, Obi-Wans Force Ghost spoke to Anakin and taught him how to return a Force Spirit. Anakin Skywalker died a hero, achieving immortality and fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One by destroying the Sith and bringing balance to the Force.</p>
