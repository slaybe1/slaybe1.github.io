      <p class="w3-justify">Darth Maul however, survived his duel with Kenobi on Naboo. He went into hiding on the junk world of Lotho Minor, sinking into insanity. He was discovered 12 years after his defeat by his brother, Savage Opress, who had been seeking a master to teach him the ways of the dark side. After finding Maul, Savage brought him to their mother, the Witch Talzin on Dathomir. She managed to restore the Sith Lords mind. After awakening, with a new pair of cybernetic legs, Maul and his brother went out to seek revenge on Obi-Wan Kenobi and Maul`s old master, Darth Sidious. Although they achieved revenge on Kenobi, killing his lover and sparing his life so he could live with the pain, they could not defeat Sidious, who came to challenge them personally. In this battle, Savage was killed and Maul was taken captive by the Dark Lord.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> A year later, Maul managed to escape from his prison and once more sought to destroy Sidious, this time with the help of his mother Talzin. But even with both their powers they could not defeat Sidious, and Talzin was killed. Maul was forced to flee into hiding, eventually becoming stranded on the ancient Sith world of Malachor, were a great power resided. The temple on the planet was a weapon that could destroy Darth Sidious`s Galactic Empire. Maul was stranded on the planet for many years, eventually coming into contact with a group of Jedi led by a Knight named Kanan Jarrus. Maul attempted to seduce Jarrus`s apprentice, Ezra Bridger, to the dark side and make him his new dark disciple, but Kanan did not allow this to happen. After dueling with Kanan, where Maul succeded in blinding the Jedi, he was forced to flee as the fight had destroyed the Sith temple. Maul stole a ship and fled into space, plotting his ultimate revenge to destroy all his enemies once and for all.</p>
