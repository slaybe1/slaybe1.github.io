      <p class="w3-justify">After his duel with Anakin, Obi-Wan took his secret wife (the former Queen of Naboo) to a secret base were he and Jedi Grand Master Yoda watched as she gave birth to Anakin's children. Sadly, the former Queen died in childbirth, leaving the children, twins Luke and Leia, without a parent. The Jedi decided to allow Kenobi to take the boy to his Aunt and Uncle's Homestead on Tatooine while Republic Senator Bail Organa would adopt Leia as his own child. Kenobi vowed to watch over the boy and planned to train him as a Jedi when he came of age. </p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> Kenobi became something of a hermit to the people of Tatooine, and his use of the force earned him the title of "Wizard". Obi-Wan changed his first name to Ben to better hide himself from the new Galactic Empire, which was founded by Darth Sidious. One day, a rebel cruiser commanded by Princess Leia came to Tatooine to find Obi-Wan and recruit him into the Rebellion in the hope that he might aid them in delivering plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon: The Death Star, a station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet. The rebel cruiser was attacked by Imperial forces led by the now cyborg Darth Vader. Seeing the Empire was close to regaining the Death Star plans, Princess Leia placed two of her droids(robots) in an escape pod with the plans and launched them to the planet surface.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> The droids were eventually captured by Jawas, local scrap traders on the planet. By pure chance the droids, known as R2-D2 and C-3PO, were bought by Luke Skywalker and his Uncle. R2-D2, remembering his mission, R2 led Luke to Old Ben's hut in the desert. There, Kenobi explained to Luke the history of the galaxy including the Clone Wars, the Jedi, and Darth Vader. After telling Luke several stories, R2-D2 played a message for Kenobi from Princess Leia imploring him to deliver the Death Star plans to her father Bail Organa on Alderaan. Luke agreed to aid him and become his student in the ways of the Force. Luke and Ben hired a smuggler named Han Solo to take them to Alderaan but when they arrived, the station had already been destroyed by the Empire. The ship containg the group was captured and while they were escaping, Kenobi dueled Darth Vader in a final lightsaber duel. Ben sacrificed himself in order to buy Luke and his companions time to escape. After he died he transcended the physical plane and became a Force Ghost, vowing to continue to teach Luke the ways of the Force.</p>
