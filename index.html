      <p class="w3-justify">So if you've made it this far it means you are somewhat interested in this because if you weren't, you'd close the browser right away! My name is Anthony Slaybe and the following pages may be perhaps some of the nerdiest things you'll ever read. And thats good because its actually some pretty awesome stuff (to me anyway). </p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> Since the 2nd grade people have asked me why I love Star Wars. I would tell them that the universe of those movies is so vast and intricate, you could never stop telling stories in it. they're also funny, soulful, and made for all ages. Plus I mean come on, lightsabers and Darth Vader are pretty cool, you cant deny that. I'll likely love Star Wars all my life and I honestly wouldnt have it any other way. Here is a quick refresher for those who dont know: Star Wars is about the battle between two organizations mainly: The Jedi, who follow the light side of the Force, a mystical energy field which gives them some awesome powers, and their way cooler evil rivals, the Dark Lords of the Sith, who follow (you guessed it) the dark side of the Force. The movies follow the story of the Skywalker Family, whose members rank among both Jedi and Sith.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> The following pages are about three different characters: Darth Maul, a powerful and badass Sith Lord, Obi-Wan Kenobi, a swagger filled Jedi Master, and Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One and main character of the first six films in the saga. Its literally impossible for me to put all the information about them on these 7 pages so I have put links on a couple of the pages to sites where you can find even more info on the characteres. So get that mouse up to the navigation bar and get your Star Wars fix!  </p>
