      <p class="w3-justify">Darth Maul was considered one of the most powerful Sith Lords in the history of the galaxy. He was born on the shrouded world of Dathomir 54 years before the events of the first Star Wars movie. the ruling Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, took Maul as his apprentice by stealing him away from his mother, the Nightsister Witch Mother Talzin. Sidious raised the boy to be weapon of pure hate and aggression, skilled in the use of the Dark Side of the Force, and considered him one of his finest students, though Sidious had no plans to make Maul his right hand when the Sith took control of the galaxy. </p>


      <p class="w3-justify"> After training the young Sith for many years and sending him on various missions, Sidious gave his apprentice the ancient sith title of Darth and sent him to dispose of 2 Jedi Knights who were protecting the Queen of the lush world of Naboo. During a massive battle to retake control of the planet for the queen, Maul engaged the two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi. Maul managed to kill Jinn and defeat Kenobi, but as he was about to finish the former, Kenobi cut Maul in half across the torso with his masters lightsaber, causing him to tumble down a pit into Naboo`s core. The Jedi and Darth Sidious believed Maul to be dead.</p>
