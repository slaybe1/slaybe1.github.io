      <p class="w3-justify">Anakin Skywalker is potentially the absolute most powerful force user to ever live. He was born around 41 years before the original movie. His mother was a slave and gave birth to him curiously without a fathers help, making Anakin a virgin birth. He lived with his mother on the desert planet of Tatooine until he was 9 years old until one day a Jedi Master known as Qui-Gon Jiin came to the planet. Jiin and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi were protecting a young queen of the planet of Naboo and stopped by Tatooine to make repairs. Seeing the potential in Anakin to not only be a Jedi but also the Chosen One, a being destined to destroy the Sith and restore balance to the Force, Jiin helped Anakin win his freedom and took Anakin along with them. They went to the Jedi Temple on coruscant where Anakin was tested to be a jedi. Initially they turned him away, but after a battle to retake the planet of Naboo, Anakins mentor Qui-Gon was slain by the Sith Lord Darth Maul. Per Jiin's dying wish, his apprentice, Obi-Wan would train Anakin tbe be a Jedi. </p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> Ten Years passed and Anakin grew into a powerful young Jedi under Kenobi's tultage. However, Anakin is reckless with his abilities and has an aptitude for questioning the Jedi Code. This is put to the ultimate test when the former queen of Naboo, Padme Amidala, becomes a Senator for the Galactic Republic and his targeted for assassination. Anakin had always been in love with Padme and he and Kenobi were assigned to protect her. Throughout this assignment he found it hard to control his feelings for Padme and after the beginning of the Clone Wars, in which Anakin lost a hand to the Sith Lord Count Dooku, he and Padme married in secret, as if Anyone found out he would surely be expelled from the Jedi Order.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> Anakin was a major player in the Galaxy spanning Clone Wars. Circa 4 months into the conflict, Anakin was made a Jedi Knight and frequently fought alongside his old master Kenobi. As the war progressed, Anakin took on an apprentice of his own: a 14-year old torgruta named Ahsoka Tano. She trained under Anakin for nearly the entire war until at the beginning of the third year of the conflict, she was expelled from the order after being falsely accused of bombing the Jedi Temple. After finding out the true culprit of the bombing, Tano still decided to leave the Order, leaving Anakin with a great mistrust of the Jedi Council.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify">Unknown to all who fought in the Clone Wars, the entire conflict was being manipulated by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who posed as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Republic. Since Anakin began his training as a young boy, Palpatine was there to mentor the boy in ways the Jedi could not. He was also preparing the boy to be his final and most powerful apprentice. Palpatine initiated this when he ordered the Seperatist army to beseige the Republic Capitol and kidnap him. The Jedi sent Skywalker and Kenobi to rescue the chancellor, who was being guarded by Dooku. In the ensuing confrontation, Anakin executed Dooku without mercy, completing his first step towards the dark side. After the battle, Anakin was troubled by visions of his secret wife, Padme Amidala, dying in childbirth. Determined not to lose her, Anakin sought out advice from Palpatine, who revealed himself as Darth Sidious and offered a chance for Anakin to become a Sith. After a battle with several Jedi who came to arrest Palpatine, Anakin pledged himself to the Sith's service. Sidious dubbed Anakin Darth Vader and tasked him with exterminating the Jedi Knights. Anakin led an assault on the Jedi Temple and killed all of the Jedi inside, razing the temple. After this event, Anakin traveled to Mustafar and massacred the Seperatist Council. Following the massacre, he was confronted by not only Padme, who was worried about him, but also Kenobi, who came to stop Anakin's brutal killing spree before it was too late. Enraged at his wife, as he believed she had brought Kenobi to kill him, Anakin force-choked her. Kenobi stopped him from killing her and fought a long battle with his apprentice. Despite Anakins great power, he could not break Kenobi's defence, and was defeated with his left arm and both legs severed as well as severely burned by the planets lava pits. Kenobi left Vader to die but Sidious rescued him before this could happen. Sidious took Vader back to coruscant and within a secret medical facility, fitted Vader with a cybernetic suit and told him once he awoke, told him that he killed Padme. Overwhelmed by grief and with his life in shambles, Vader accepted his Sith persona fully and vowed to destroy anything that reminded him of his past life as Anakin Skywalker.</p>
